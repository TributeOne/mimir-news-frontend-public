# Mímir News Frontend
## Getting Started

The Mimir News Frontend is the mobile application for the news platform of Mimir News. Mimir News is a startup founded in 2020 by @Peyshaun (Payton B.) and @nowaythatworked (Jan C.). The idea was to develop an AI-based news app that automatically collects news from various news providers worldwide, compares them, and recognizes if they report on the same topic.

For example, if the AI ​​determines that CNN and BBC each have a news item about "Facebook changing their name to Meta", the news is linked together and displayed in the app as a post. The AI ​​generates a headline and a brief summary of the topic based on the collected data from all linked news. Links to the news providers reporting on the topic are provided below the summary.

The purpose of the links is to allow the user to decide for themselves which news portal they want to read the full news on. The app is also intended to allow the user to compare how different news providers report on the same news.

This repository only contains the frontend for mobile devices such as iOS and Android, which I was responsible for. The design, structure of the app, and logo were created entirely by me.

To set up the project, you also need the "backend-service" project from @nowaythatworked, which has not yet been published at the current time. The backend is based on a NestJS API and is responsible for managing and providing the API interfaces of the app, including user authentication. "backend-service" also collects all news portals worldwide using web scrapers and adds them to a database.

The project was discontinued in mid-2022 because no investor was found and the career paths and interests of the project participants went in different directions.
